Assignment 4

Student(s): 

For this assignment, marking will work a little differently
The marks on the right do not add up to 100%, however instead
you will lose the given amount of marks if the feature is
not implemented properly. This means that instead of starting
with 0% and gaining marks, you are essentially starting the
assignment with 100% and losing marks based on things which
are not finished.

Code Style / Modularity / Readability                          5

    - Code has consistent indenting
    - Functions used where appropriate
    - Student comments where explanation necessary

Drawing / Animations                                               

    - All entities properly read from level file and drawn    10
      entities are drawn in the correct rooms
      entities are drawn in the centre of their tile
    - Player animations set properly based on state           10
      Run animation doesn't play when just left/right
      or up/down both held
    - Sword animation appears in correct place and direction  10
      sword animation moves with player, has proper lifespan
      explosions have no collision box
    
Game Play Functionality                                            
    

    - Player moves properly when correct keys pressed         10
      CInput flags used 'properly' within input system
      Player can only attack when previous attack has ended
      Player config settings used properly
    - Player and NPCs collide with tiles that block movement  10
      Player respawns after touching NPC
      Sword destroys NPCs on collision
    - Camera mode switching works correctly                   15
      follow mode follows link everywhere
      room mode works in all rooms (including "off the map")
    - NPC Patrol AI works correctly                           15
      Patrol positions followed in order (looping)
      No oscillation around destination
    - NPC Follow AI works correctly                           15
      NPC moves directly towards player if line of sight
      not blocked. Only vision blocking tiles and NPCs block
      line of sight. NPC moves directly toward home if there
      is not line of sight to player
    - Music & Sounds work properly                            10
    - Damage / hit points work properly                       10
    - Heart pickup works properly                              5
    - Teleporting black tiles work properly                    5
    - Pause functionality correctly implemented                5
    - Custom Level file included (at least two rooms)         10

Bonus Marks

    - Up to 10% bonus for cool additional functionality
            
Assignment Mark                                               100/100
